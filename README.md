# Silkworm Plan
This is a light-weight planning web app for setting up, organizing and even simple sharing of plans/workflows.

(This branch of refactoring upon the original **Silkworm Plan** is still under development, to be merged to branch `master` later. But all basic features and internal state management is already available, please follow the instructions below to spot.)

## To use
One can either visit this [link](https://znss1989.github.io/silkworm), or clone the repo then 
1. `npm install` all the dependencies.
2. `npm run start`, then run the app in your favorite browser locally. 

Let's plan it out!
